## 🧪 **Testing Your System**

### **Expected Behavior:**
1. **Call connects** → Welcome messages play
2. **WebSocket establishes** → Real-time translation begins
3. **You speak English** → Other person hears Hindi
4. **Other person speaks Hindi** → You hear English

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **Call disconnects after welcome**: WebSocket connection failed
- **No translation**: Check Google Cloud credentials
- **Audio issues**: Check Twilio account credits

## 📊 **System Architecture**

```
Twilio Call → ngrok Tunnel → Flask Server → WebSocket Server
                ↓
            Google Cloud APIs:
            - Speech-to-Text
            - Translation
            - Text-to-Speech
```

---

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

✅ **Call connects successfully**
✅ **Welcome messages play**
✅ **WebSocket connection established**
✅ **Real-time translation works**
✅ **Bidirectional communication**

---

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Test current setup** with the ngrok URL
2. **If WebSocket fails**, deploy to Railway
3. **For production**, use Railway or ngrok paid plan
4. **Monitor logs** for any issues

---

## 🆘 **Support**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check server logs in terminal
2. Verify Google Cloud credentials
3. Ensure Twilio webhook is configured correctly
4. Check ngrok tunnel status

**Your system is ready to test! 🎊**
